# _Local Restaurant and Businesses API_

_30 October 2020_

#### _API for finding local restaurant and shop data_

#### By _**Vanessa Stewart**_

## Description

_This is a Friday project for Epicodus. The original instructions for the project include:_

For your final Ruby/Rails code review, you may build one of the three APIs below. (You may also build an API of your choosing if you prefer.)

Animal Shelter: Create an API for a local animal shelter. The API will list the available cats and dogs at the shelter.
Local Business Lookup: Create an API for a local business lookup. The API will list restaurants and shops in town.
Parks Lookup: Create an API for state and national parks. The API will list state and national parks.
You have the freedom to build out your APIs as you wish. Try adding the following to your API:

Endpoints for GET (all and by id), POST, PUT and DELETE.
A RANDOM endpoint that randomly returns a park/business/animal.
A second custom endpoint that accepts parameters (example: a SEARCH route that allows users to search by specific park names).
Model scopes to process parameters from API calls.
At least one of the objectives from Monday's Further Exploration lesson (such as versioning, token authentication, or serialization).
Thorough exception handling.
Complete testing with request specs.
Randomized data with Faker or your own custom seed code.
A README that thoroughly documents all endpoints, including parameters that can be passed in.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

To Access and Extend This Project:

1. Install Rails
- For this project, you will need Ruby. Follow the directions [here](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/ruby-and-rails/getting-started-with-ruby/ruby-installation-and-setup) for setting up Ruby.
- Install Rails on your machine with the following terminal command `gem install rails -v 5.2.0`

2. Clone Repo and Install Bundler
- Navigate to the directory on your local computer where you would like to clone this repo.
- Clone this repo using the `git clone` command in terminal/command line.
- Navigate to the cloned folder and run `gem install bundler` to install Bundler, which will mange all gem installations for our project.
- Run `bundle` or `bundle install` in your command line to download all dependencies. (If you add additional gems later, you will need to run `bundle update <gem name>`.)

3. Set Up Database
- Run `rake db:setup` in the terminal. This is akin to running the following rake tasks all at once: db:create(creates the dev and test databases for the current env), db:schema:load (recreates the database from the schema.rb file), and db:seed(runs the db/seed.rb file).

4. Open in Text Editor
- Open the cloned repo in a text editor of your choice.
- To Run Tests: While in the root directory of this project, run `rspec` in your command line.
- To Run the App in Browser: While in the root directory of the project, run `rails s` in the terminal. This will start a server, which you can access by entering `localhost:3000` in your browser.
